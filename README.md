    Schematic
         -- Dragon wants this to be able to read schematics from other mods in a pack.
    These only work if the player has the required blocks
    Player Must have the required blocks in their inventory to create the schematic.
     
    Permissions:
         Need to be able to limit amount of blocks changed by amount of power. (points system?)
     
    Power/Energy/Points (Need more info from Dragon)
         Max power: 9100
             Source energy/power is not stable. As they build the schematic their energy drains.
                 -- If the energy/power reaches 0, it begins to drain the players hunger.
                     -- The overall energy reserves may also fluctuate based on what the player is doing.
                         For example: --The higher the level of sunlight, the stronger their power is.
                              --The player receives a small amount of energy regeneration from sleeping.
                              --Radiation can be converted into source energy. (No damage)(More powerful than sunlight)
             Each time a player launches and completes a schematic their power (points?) will increase.
                 -- Once the schematic completes, the players regains power/energy.
                 -- Power gained from Schematic completion is less than what is expended when the schematic is being constructed.
         Transmute -  A player gains so much power that they can now transmute the world around them into the needed blocks
             -- This skill gained at a threshold of 6000?
             
    Note:
         Dragon wanted to add that launching a schematic should also allow a player to fly for the duration of the
             schematic's construction.
             
             He also wanted to create the "power/energy/points" in such a way that having a high energy level can
             also shield you from potentially hostile mobs and lower the damage taken from drowning.
